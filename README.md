# Hello

I developed my first **GitHub Pages Website** as a way of practicing my projects.

## Tools used

* VScode
  
## Steps

  1. Create new repository in my user name: e.g UserName.github.io
  2. Turn on GitHub Pages (new repo.-> setting-> turn on GItHub Pages)
  3. Create index.html file
  4. Create style.CSS sheet
  5. Clone my repository using VSCode to my computer
  6. Write my Code in VSCode
  7. Commit and push back to my GitHub

## Documents Used

* index.html:where I created content of my webpage.

* style.css: where I add styling rules to my content.

* images:which I add in my homepage
